# Computer Science II
## Lab 2.0 - Operators and Conditions

An introduction to the operators and conditions in the Java programming language.  

This is a lab used in Computer Science II (CSCE 156) for Fall 2023 
in the [School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu) 
at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

## Overview

### Resources

* `operator tutorial`:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html
* `if-else tutorial`:
http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html


### Lab Objectives & Topics
Following the lab, you should be able to:
* use operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
* use `if-else` statements to control the logical flow of the
  program.

### Peer Programming Pair-Up

At the start of
each lab, you may find a team member by yourself or may be randomly paired up with another student by
a lab instructor.  One of you will be designated the *driver* 
and the other the *navigator*. If you prefer to work on this lab by yourself, that is fine too.  
Each week you should try to alternate: if you were a driver 
last week, be a navigator next, etc. 

***Note that, each student must submit the code to CodePost for grading.***

## 1. Getting Started

Clone this project code for this lab from GitHub in Eclipse using the
URL: https://github.com/lisongxu/CSCE156-Lab-Java-Cond. Please refer to [Lab 1.0](https://github.com/lisongxu/CSCE156-Lab-Java-Intro) for
instructions on how to clone a project from GitHub in Eclipse.


## 2. Modifying the Statistics Java Programs

We continue to work on the Statistics Java programs. Note that the Statistics code in this lab is different from that of Lab 1, so you must clone the project code for this lab from GitHub.

Please modify `Statistics.java` as required below, so that `StatisticsDemo.java` outputs the correct answers. 

1. Expand the `src/main/java` directory, then expand the `unl.soc` package, and then double click on the `Statistics.java` file to open it.
2. Implement the `getMax()` method in the `Statistics` class.  Use the 
`getMin()`	method for directions on syntax.
3. Implement the `getSum()` method in the `Statistics` class.  Use the 
other methods for direction on syntax.
4. Expand the `src` directory, expand the `unl.soc` package, double click on the `StatisticsDemo.java` file to open it.
5. Click on the "play" button to execute `StatisticsDemo.java`, and check the output in the "console" tab
 

## 3. Testing, Submitting and Grading

### 3.1 Testing Locally

Before you submit your lab, you should run the JUnit tests locally to verify 
that your code is correct.  

1. Expand the `src/test/java` directory, then expand the `unl.soc` package, and then double click on the `StatisiticsTests.java` file to open it.   
2. Run the test suite by clicking the usual "Play" button.
3. A report will be presented in a JUnit tab detailing which test cases pass and
which fail along with expected output and the actual output (for 
failed test cases).

### 3.2 Submitting to CodePost

To submit your lab, do the following:

1. Login to https://codepost.io   

2. Click "Upload Assignment" for this lab.

3. Click "Upload files" to upload `Statistics.java`, and then click the "Submit and run test" button.

4. Click on the "View test results" button to
view the test results, and make sure that you pass all tests. 

### 3.3 Grading

For this lab, as long as you pass all the tests on Codepost, you will get full credit for the lab.
